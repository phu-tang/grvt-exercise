- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

## Solution

- State management: redux
  - Slice to handle reducer
  - RTK query to handle api request
  - Redux persist to handle persist data (support display offline)
- Reducer explanation:
  - coins reducer: contains all coins information such as name, symble, etc. The values will be get from latest coin api
  - quote reducer: contain all quotes from the given by the coins. The values will be get from get coins latest api and quotes api.
- Data render:
  - UI lib: `@shopify/flash-list` for better performance.
  - List render by list of ID (keys in coin reducer)
  - Item render by connected component (data given by key: information from coins reducer and pricing from quote)
  - search: using state to handle value then filter by seletector (key selector)
  - polling api base useEffect life cycle (start interval) and the of ids in screen controlled by state and update debonce by `onViewableItemsChanged`
  - Data load more, and pull to refresh handled by Flashlist props
